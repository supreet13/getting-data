The features selected for this data frame came from the transformation of the data in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0", which in turn have been taken from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz data were captured, of accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
